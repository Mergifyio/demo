            It will be put in queue automatically by Mergify right now.

            You can chose the queue by adding a label:
            - Use the `hotfix` label to put the PR in the hotfix queue;
            - Use the `lowprio` label to put the PR in the lowprio queue;
            - Do not set any label to have it enter the default queue.
          labels: autoqueue
      - name: Create the hotfix pull request
        if: ${{ ! inputs.autoqueue }}
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
        with:
          title: "A pull request"
          body: >
            This is a test pull request!

            To put it in queue, run the `@mergifyio queue` command by posting a
            comment.

            You can use label to route the PR to any queue:
            - `@mergifyio queue hotfix` to enter the hotfix queue;
            - `@mergifyio queue` to enter the default queue;
            - `@mergifyio queue lowprio` to enter the lowprio queue;
          labels:
